## Part I – Terms of Service

### 1. Introduction
These Terms of Service (“**Terms**”) govern your use of any mobile application we publish (collectively, “**Apps**,” “**we**,” “**our**,” or “**us**”). By downloading, installing, or using an App you agree to these Terms. If you do not agree, **do not use the Apps**.

### 2. Eligibility & Account Responsibilities
- **Age Requirement** – You must be at least 13 years old (or the legal minimum in your jurisdiction).  
- **Compliance** – You will comply with all applicable laws and regulations.  
- **Account Security** – If an App allows account creation, you are responsible for safeguarding credentials and all activity under your account.

### 3. License & Acceptable Use
1. **Limited License** – We grant you a personal, non-exclusive, revocable, non-transferable license to use the Apps subject to these Terms.  
2. **Prohibited Conduct** – You must not:  
   - reverse-engineer, decompile, or disassemble the Apps;  
   - modify, translate, or create derivative works;  
   - violate any law or third-party right;  
   - exploit voting, leaderboard, or reward systems (e.g., multi-account voting);  
   - upload unlawful, harmful, or infringing content;  
   - bypass security or access systems without authorization.  
3. **Reservation of Rights** – All rights not expressly granted are reserved.

### 4. Intellectual Property
All trademarks, logos, source code, artwork, audio, and other content in the Apps are owned by us or our licensors and are protected by intellectual-property laws.

### 5. Purchases, Subscriptions & Fees
- **In-App Purchases & Subscriptions** – Certain features may require a one-time fee or recurring subscription. Prices are shown in the App-Store listing and may vary.  
- **Billing & Renewal** – Subscriptions renew automatically unless canceled at least 24 hours before the end of the current period.  
- **Cancellation** – Manage or cancel via your App-Store account settings. Deleting the App does **not** cancel a subscription.  
- **Refunds** – All sales are final except where required by law or the App-Store provider.

### 6. Advertising & Rewards
The Apps may display ads (interstitial, rewarded, app-open, etc.) served by third-party networks such as Google AdMob. Viewing rewarded ads may grant in-app benefits subject to in-app terms.

### 7. Disclaimer of Warranties
The Apps are provided **“as is”** and **“as available”** without warranties of any kind. Features (including characters, athletes, or other content) may be added, modified, or removed at our sole discretion at any time.

### 8. Limitation of Liability & Release
To the maximum extent permitted by law, we shall not be liable for indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, or for loss of profits, data, or goodwill. You release us from liability arising out of voting, leaderboard, or reward features, subject to applicable laws and third-party rights.

### 9. Indemnification
You agree to defend, indemnify, and hold us harmless from any claims or losses arising from your violation of these Terms or misuse of the Apps.

### 10. Termination
We may suspend or terminate access to any App at any time, with or without notice, for conduct that violates these Terms or is harmful to us, users, or third parties.

### 11. Governing Law & Dispute Resolution
Unless mandatory local law says otherwise, these Terms are governed by the laws of the jurisdiction where we are incorporated, without regard to conflict-of-laws rules. Disputes shall be resolved in the competent courts of that jurisdiction.

### 12. Changes to the Terms
We may modify these Terms at any time. Material changes take effect 30 days after posting. Continued use of an App constitutes acceptance of the revised Terms.
